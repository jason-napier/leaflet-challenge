# USGS Earthquake Visualization Tool

## Overview

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) plays a crucial role in monitoring and reporting on earthquakes around the globe. This project aims to enhance the USGS's capabilities by developing an interactive visualization tool for their earthquake data. By accurately and dynamically representing earthquake magnitudes and depths on a global scale, this tool seeks to inform the public and governmental organizations about seismic activities, fostering a better understanding of the Earth's processes and the challenges we face.

## Project Goals

The primary objective of this project is to create a meaningful visualization of the USGS's earthquake data. This tool will display real-time data on earthquakes worldwide, using magnitude and depth to dictate the visual representation of seismic events on a map. 

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Utilizes Leaflet.js to render an interactive map that serves as the canvas for earthquake data visualization.
- **Real-time Data**: Connects to the USGS GeoJSON feed to pull in real-time earthquake data.
- **Magnitude Representation**: Earthquake markers on the map scale in size according to the earthquake's magnitude, providing an immediate visual cue of the event's severity.
- **Depth Representation**: The color of each marker reflects the earthquake's depth, offering insights into the seismic event's origin within the Earth's crust.
- **Tooltips**: Interactive tooltips provide detailed information about each earthquake, including magnitude, location, and depth.
- **Legend**: A map legend explains the color coding used for depth, enhancing the map's interpretability.

## Deployment

This visualization tool is deployed as a web application. Users can access the tool through any modern web browser to view the latest earthquake data in an interactive format.

## Acknowledgments

This project was made possible by the data and support provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Their commitment to sharing open data and advancing Earth science research is invaluable.
